# custom-enumerable
Recreating basic enumerable methods

 The goal of this project is to create new versions of frequently used methods available in the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. 
 And also practise to use procs and blocs.
 
  Methods to recreate: 
  
  #my_each
  
  #my_each_with_index
  
  #my_select
  
  #my_all?
  
  #my_any?
  
  #my_none?
  
  #my_count
  
  #my_map
  
  #my_inject
